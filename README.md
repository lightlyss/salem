## Description
A short story about magic and despair inspired by various media. Uses a modified
template for novels or storybooks, originally from LyX. If you'd like to use the
template yourself, modify `src/cover.tex` and `src/chapters/ch-#.tex` as needed.

## Building
Run `make` to build the PDF document. `make clean` is also provided to clear
all built artifacts.
